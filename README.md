# Project Repository

This repository will be used for team projects.

Several sets of instructions are included in this repository. They should each be treated as separate assignments with their own due dates and sets of requirements.

1. See the [App Map & Wireframes](instructions-0a-app-map-wireframes.md) and [Prototyping](./instructions-0b-prototyping.md) instructions for the requirements of the initial user experience design of the app.

1. Delete the contents of this file and replace with the contents of a proper README.md, as described in the [project setup instructions](./instructions-0c-project-setup.md)

1. See the [Sprint Planning instructions](instructions-0d-sprint-planning.md) for the requirements of Sprint Planning for each Sprint.

1. See the [Front-End Development instructions](./instructions-1-front-end.md) for the requirements of the initial Front-End Development.

1. See the [Back-End Development instructions](./instructions-2-back-end.md) for the requirements of the initial Back-End Development.

1. See the [Database Integration instructions](./instructions-3-database.md) for the requirements of integrating a database into the back-end.

1. See the [Deployment instructions](./instructions-4-deployment.md) for the requirements of deploying an app.

Every project must have a README.md that automatically renders on the project's main repository page with basic details of the project, including:

a description of project, including the Product Vision Statement
the core team members, including links to their GitHub accounts and any other web presence they have
a short history of how the project came to be and information about how to contribute to the project (i.e. a link to the CONTRIBUTING.md document)
instructions for building and testing the project (update with that information once the project reaches that stage)
links to any additional Markdown documents or web pages that may be relevant reading about the project
anything else you think is important to communicate to people viewing the project
